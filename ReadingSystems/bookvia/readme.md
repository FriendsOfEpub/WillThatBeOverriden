# Bookvia

Multiple references (and files related) to Mantano/Bookari can be found in the iOS package (besides Readium.shared.js).

It is very likely this app is built with the Bookari Reading System, especially as the UI is exactly the same, there is a lot of MNO-prefixed files and this reading system supports [Readium’s LCP](http://readium.org/projects/readium-lcp) (Sony DRM scheme is compatible with it).

CSS provided from Mantano’s folder in the app’s package.
